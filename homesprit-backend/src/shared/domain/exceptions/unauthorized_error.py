"""
Unauthorized error exception.

Raised when authentication itself fails — bad credentials, or a token that is
missing, malformed or expired.

Ported from hgs-backend, which added it because — unlike sp-company-backend,
where Clerk owns the credential exchange — it owns login itself, so an
invalid-credentials failure originates in a USE CASE, and use cases must raise
domain exceptions rather than HTTP ones. Homesprit owns login for the same
reason.
