"""The slug rule, in one place.

A slug is the URL segment a listing lives at — `/properties/sunny-loft-in-dhanmondi`.
Ported unchanged from hgs-backend, where five entities share it; here only
`Property` carries one today, but the rule is the same and so is the module.

The rule has to be applied at TWO layers, and for different reasons:

- On the request schema, so a malformed slug is rejected by FastAPI as a 422
  naming the field, before any use case runs.
- On the entity, so the same value cannot reach the database through a code
  path that skipped the schema — a seed script, a test, a future internal
  caller.

Without the schema layer the entity's ValueError surfaces from inside the use
case as an unhandled pydantic error and the API answers 500 for what is plainly
a bad request. Without the entity layer the database would accept `Hello
World!` as a URL segment.
