"""
Authentication dependencies for FastAPI endpoints.

Provides dependency injection for authentication and authorization:
- get_current_user: Extract and validate the user from a JWT
- hasAccess: Universal access control with a role list

Ported from hgs-backend, which kept sp-company-backend's exact name and
signature shape for ``hasAccess`` so route code reads identically across the
projects. Homesprit keeps it too; the only change is the entity it resolves
(``User`` with two roles rather than ``AdminUser`` with one).

Roles are checked here. OWNERSHIP — whether this agent may touch this listing —
is not: only the use case has the row, so it raises ``ForbiddenError`` there.
