"""In-process rate limiting, for the endpoints where an attacker gets to retry.

Ported from hgs-backend unchanged apart from the limiter instances at the
bottom. sp-company-backend's limiter needs Redis; this one needs nothing: a
fixed window in a dict, guarded by a lock.

**Know what this does and does not buy you.** The counters live in one process's
memory, so:

- Across several workers, each worker enforces the limit separately. Four
  Uvicorn workers means four times the configured allowance.
- A restart forgets every counter.

It still closes the case that matters here. Online password guessing needs
thousands of attempts against one account; five per fifteen minutes stops that
whether or not the count is shared perfectly. It is NOT a defence against a
distributed flood — that belongs at the reverse proxy, which sees every worker.

Fixed window rather than sliding: a sliding window needs the timestamp of every
request, and the burst a fixed window permits at a boundary (2× the limit across
two adjacent windows) is irrelevant against a five-per-quarter-hour budget.
