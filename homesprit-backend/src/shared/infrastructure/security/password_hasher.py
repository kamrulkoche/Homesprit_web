"""Password hashing for staff accounts (admins and agents).

Uses bcrypt directly. There is no equivalent module in sp-company-backend —
Clerk owned credential storage there, so that repo has no hashing at all and
its only `verify_password` calls are remote Clerk API calls.

Deliberately NOT using passlib: its last release was 2020, and it reads
``bcrypt.__about__.__version__``, which bcrypt 5.x removed — the combination
emits an AttributeError trap on first hash.

bcrypt notes that matter:
  - The algorithm silently truncates input at 72 BYTES. A caller passing a
    longer passphrase would get a hash covering only the first 72 bytes, so
    ``hash_password`` rejects it loudly instead.
  - Each hash embeds its own salt and cost, so ``verify_password`` needs no
    stored parameters and an old hash keeps verifying after COST is raised.
